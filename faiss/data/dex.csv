barboach,"Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility hides this Pokmon from predators, and the slime on its body makes grasping it difficult."
whiscash,Strikes its caudal fin against the swamp bed to shake the ground and startle its prey. It will then swallow the fleeing prey whole. People mistook this behavior as the cause of earthquakes.

starly,"They live in the fields and mountains, gathering in large flocks. Their cries are quite obnoxious. Though small, their wings are stronga strike from them leaves pain that persists for a week."
staravia,They form remarkably large flocks and are constantly fighting amongst themselves. I suspect that those with magnificent plumes on their heads are the strong ones.
staraptor,"It has left the flock, having gained strength enough to survive on its own. The astounding force with which Staraptor flies through the air allows it to carry away large, burly targets."
bidoof,Bidoof has an unsophisticated face and is rarely flustered by anything. There have been incidents involving Bidoof sauntering into villages and gnawing on the houses without a single care.
bibarel,Bibarel fur repels water and is also a fantastic material for heat retention. These Pokmon create dams on rivers to live in.

wormadam,"The cloakfashioned from plant matterhas merged with the Pokmon and is now part of the body, like fur or skin. I suspect this fusion is an effect of the energy involved in evolution."

cherubi,"Once the fruit growing alongside the main body is large and plump, Cherubi will use the nutrients within to evolve. The fruit then detaches, becoming nourishment for other creatures."

shellos,Found in abundance on seashores bordering warm waters. Shellos are unexpectedly friendly and will crawl toward any person they see. Take care not to get coated in mucus!

drifblim,"It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy aspect touches some people deeplyevery so often, one will come upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim."
buneary,My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pokmon protects its hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears.
lopunny,"Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pokmon kicks as though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents with ease."
mismagius,"The incantations Mismagius chants can ward against misfortune, so a custom exists of inviting it into one's home. Incur the Pokmon's displeasure, however, and disaster will surely ensue."
honchkrow,"One cry from this Pokmon, and a murder of Murkrow come flying. At such times, one would think the curtain of night had fallen, plunging the world into jet-black darkness."

purugly,"Though impudent and difficult to tame, Purugly enjoys great popularity due to its fur, the beauty of which surpasses even velveteen."
chingling,This Pokmon gave me an excruciating headache when it seemingly cried out without making a sound. Perhaps there are some sounds that the human ear is simply incapable of hearing.
stunky,The poison that gushes from its aft end is accompanied by an utterly evil-smelling odor with such potency that one whiff can induce memory loss.

hippowdon,"Short-tempered and easily moved to violence. It whips up whirlwinds of sand to crush its foes' spirits, then goes in for the attack."

glaceon,"Glaceon is able to lower its body temperature very quickly. It freezes the atmosphere, creating diamond dust that glitters like gems while it flutters and dances around."
gliscor,It glides soundlessly on pitch-black wings and sinks sharp fangs into the throat of its prey. It takes on a look of satisfaction once it has entirely drained its prey of blood.
mamoswine,"This species reached its zenith during the period known as the ice age. I suspect that Hisui's frigid climate is in harmony with Mamoswine's constitution, thus awakening hidden potential."
porygonz,"A curious item induced this evolution. The Pokmon's offensive capabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its behavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me."

giratina,There is one Hisuian verse that tells of a powerful light creating a deep shadow. I imagine that this deep shadow is Giratina.
cresselia,Cresselia is reminiscent of the crescent moon. It leaves a brilliant line of light in its wake as it flies across the night sky. I daresay it resembles the heavenly maiden who created the Milky Way.
phione,Can be seen floating offshore during seasons when the seas are warm. Its azure body blends in with the ocean waterslogic suggests this is a defense mechanism against natural predators.
manaphy,"Rumored to migrate across the oceans and visit Hisui's coastal waters only rarely. Although Manaphy resembles Phione, it is also quite different. The relation between the two is unclear."

rufflet,"Its chick-like looks belie its hotheadedness. It challenges its parents at every opportunity, desperate to prove its strength."

thundurus,"They say this wielder of electricity has waged war with its nemesis, Tornadus, since time immemorial. The lightning bolts it hurls pierce the very earth and enrich the soil."
landorus,"When the incarnations of wind and of lightning clash, Landorus arrives to quell the conflict. After the tempests and thunderbolts abate, the land is sure to be blessed with bountiful harvests."
sylveon,It emits a soothing aura from its ribbon-shaped organs. It wraps these appendages around quarrelers to instantly restore calm to the situation.

dartrix,"Regularly basks in sunlight to gather powerpresumably due to the frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set into its wings are keen as ever."
wyrdeer,The black orbs shine with an uncanny light when the Pokmon is erecting invisible barriers. The fur shed from its beard retains heat well and is a highly useful material for winter clothing.

ursaluna,I believe it was Hisui's swampy terrain that gave Ursaluna its burly physique and newfound capacity to manipulate peat at will.

palkiaorigin,It soars across the sky in a form that greatly resembles the creator of all things. Perhaps this imitation of appearance is Palkia's strategy for gaining Arceus's powers.
giratinaorigin,"Giratina loses its legs upon changing into this form. I believe this Pokmon must hail from a world where the heavens and the earth are as one, though I have no way of proving it."
shayminsky,"Upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms. I took a whiff of the flower myself, but alas, my body remained unchanged."
samurotthisui,"Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is a product of the Pokmon's evolution in the region of Hisui. Its turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves."
lilliganthisui,I suspect that its well-developed legs are the result of a life spent on mountains covered in deep snow. The scent it exudes from its flower crown heartens those in proximity.

landorustherian,"Landorus soars through the sky in this form, bestowing plentiful harvests upon the land and earning the people's reverence. It can traverse the whole of Hisui in a mere couple of hours."
